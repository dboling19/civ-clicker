# Civ Clicker

This is a fork of the open source game CivClicker, an incremental game by Katherine Stark and Scott A.
Colcord. 
I disliked the style of the game and wanted to configure some things.  It was last updated in 2017 so I figured I would take up the mantle and offer some different styles, including a dark mode.
